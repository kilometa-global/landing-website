            Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, tyt has updated health safety guidelines to help keep drivers and passengers safe. Under the new guidelines, drivers and passengers must stay home if they have COVID-19 or related symptoms, wear a face covering, keep the front seat empty, and roll windows down when possible. Drivers or passengers who repeatedly violate these new guidelines will be suspended. If a driver ever has a health safety concern, like someone not wearing a face covering, they can cancel the ride without incurring a fee.
